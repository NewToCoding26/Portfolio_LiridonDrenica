            Hello, my name is Liridon Drenica and I'm teaching myself how to learn to code since one year, sadly with 
            a lot of breaks because of my private life, but I'm still giving my best and I hope I can impress you with my portfolio.
            On this portfolio you will find my projects, learning plan, profiles on GitHub, LinkedIn and my CV. I hope I am able 
            and find the time to constantly update this page. <br> <strong> Have fun exploring my portfolio! </strong>

            <strong>How did you teach yourself programming?</strong> <br> <br>

            A: I taught myself everything autodidactically. In the first few weeks, I took extensive notes on the basics, like what types of 
            developers exist and what languages are needed for each. I then decided on web development and invested my time learning HTML,
            CSS & JavaScript. <br> <br>

            <strong>You studied Political Science for 3 years before switching to Computer Science. How did this transition come about?</strong> <br> <br>

            A: I didn't really know what to do after graduation and only knew that I was quite good at politics in school, which is why I 
            chose that field. However, after some time I realized that it wasn't for me because it was too theoretical and didn't have 
            much to do with real politics. That's when I started teaching myself programming because I had an interest in it, and then 
            enrolled at a university for Computer Science. <br> <br>

            <strong>What do you want to specialize in?</strong> <br> <br>

            A: Initially, I wanted to become a fullstack developer, but over time I realized that it's too much. So I want to first become an
            expert in frontend and additionally learn backend fundamentals like SQL, database design, and server setup. <br> <br>

            <strong>How would you be an asset to our team?</strong> <br> <br>

            A: First, I would say that I'm an easygoing person who can adapt depending on the situation and person, which is why I've 
            gotten along well with everyone in my life so far. Additionally, I bring the ability to learn very well autodidactically 
            because I'm very disciplined - a skill I transferred from sports to my life, as I've lost over 50 kg. <br> <br>

            <strong>How do you handle setbacks when your code doesn't work immediately?</strong> <br> <br>

            A: I think you should realize that every developer experiences this, regardless of how many years they've been developing, so 
            you shouldn't give up immediately and should stay calm. I first try to fix the code myself for a while. If that doesn't work, 
            I try to find and fix the error with AI, as I believe every programmer should be familiar with AI. While AI won't replace pro
            grammers, a programmer who knows AI will replace one who doesn't. However, I'm also human and of course I get frustrated some
            times after several hours, and then my commit message looks like "khggj" (when I'm not working with anyone) and I close my lap
            top in frustration. These days exist too, especially when learning autodidactically without a teacher by your side. <br> <br>

            <strong>What projects are you most proud of?</strong> <br> <br>

            A: I really only have two projects: the JJBA Quiz and my portfolio. I'm more proud of the JJBA Quiz because it was my first pro
            ject and it also has emotional value for me, representing my journey into programming. <br> <br>

            <strong>What's your experience with version control (Git)?</strong> <br> <br>

            A: I've been using Git and GitHub since day one. When I started learning, every tutorial I watched emphasized that these tools 
            are essential to master. You can check out my GitHub portfolio, which you'll find linked at the bottom of this website. <br> <br>

            <strong>What's your experience working in teams?</strong> <br> <br>

            A: To be honest, I last worked in teams during my school years, and there I was usually the organizer. I would collect everyone's
            schedules and find common times for us to study together.

            <strong>Where do you see yourself in 2-3 years?</strong> <br> <br>

            A: It depends on whether I can find an apprenticeship and pursue that path first. If not, I'll probably work as a freelancer and 
            offer my services on platforms like Fiverr. <br> <br>

            <strong>How do you handle tight deadlines?</strong> <br> <br>

            A: Luckily, I'm a person who starts tasks immediately instead of waiting until the deadline approaches, so I haven't really 
            experienced stress with deadlines so far. <br> <br>

            <strong>Are you available for remote/hybrid work?</strong> <br> <br>

            A: Actually, I would prefer remote work if it's an option. <br> <br>
