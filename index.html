            Hello, my name is Liridon Drenica and I'm teaching myself how to learn to code since one year, sadly with 
            a lot of breaks because of my private life, <br> but I'm still giving my best and I hope I can impress you with my portfolio.
            On this portfolio you will find my projects, learning plan, profiles on GitHub, LinkedIn and my CV. I hope I am able 
            and find the time to constantly update this page. <br> <strong> Have fun exploring my portfolio! </strong>
